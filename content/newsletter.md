When it comes to software, I love exploring new things. This **monthly** newsletter is my way of sharing those learnings with you.

I'll cover topics in the cloud native ecosystem and broader tech in general. Along with random interesting things I find on the internet.

If you're someone who's curious too and loves learning new things, then I definitely recommend signing up :)
