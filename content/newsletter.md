When it comes to software, I love exploring new things. This **weekly** newsletter is my way of sharing those learnings with you.

I'll cover topics in the cloud native ecosystem and broader tech in general. Along with random interesting things I find on the internet.

If you're someone who's curious too and loves learning new things, then I definitely recommend signing up :)

Every Monday I share:

- Interesting links of the week: Articles, videos, or talks in the DevOps and Cloud space that I’ve personally read or watched and found valuable.

- Something that sparked my curiosity: Something cool or fun I’m currently learning or working on, which might interest you too.

- Golang puzzle of the week: A coding question or interview problem in Go for you to solve.

- Who’s hiring?: A curated list of companies hiring for engineering, product, marketing, or sales roles in the cloud space.
