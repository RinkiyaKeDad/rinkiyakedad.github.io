Hey! My name is Arsh. Across the internet, you'll also find me as **@RinkiyaKeDad** in many places. I'm currently a Developer Experience Engineer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/). 

My experience in various engineering roles, combined with my ability to explain technical concepts in a simple way, allows me to offer unique value.
I'm usually the engineer on the non-engineering teams. What does that mean?
- I work with Marketing to create technical content, tutorials, demos, and collaborations with other products.
- I work with Product teams to provide developer-centric feedback and assist in documentation efforts.
- I team up with Sales to provide case studies, competitor analysis, and other content to help close deals.
