Hey! My name is Arsh. Across the internet, you'll also find me as **@RinkiyaKeDad** in many places.

With a diverse background in engineering roles, open source, and a knack for simplifying complex technical concepts, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Often, I find myself being the "engineer" on non-engineering teams. What does that mean?

- **Marketing**: I create technical content tailored to ICPs and actively promote developer tools through evangelism, community engagement, and partnerships with other products.
- **Product**: I provide actionable developer-centric feedback, refine documentation for clarity and usability, and influence the roadmap to align with real-world developer needs.
- **Sales**: I craft compelling case studies, conduct competitor analyses, and create technical assets that highlight product value, allowing teams to close deals effectively.
